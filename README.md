# BabelBots

This repository stores Clients that interact with and call the GRPC server in the [Prose-and-Babel-API repository](https://github.com/jfahmy/Prose-and-Babel-API).

This repository also stores the code that interacts with the Twitter API to run the Twitter bots @BardFibonacci, @BotQuixotic, and @WorldFameBot.  These bots are run using credentials from my Twitter developer accounts and therefore serve only as examples of possible GRPC clients - this repository will not be useful if you download and attempt to run the code.  

Twitter clients were built using the [Python Twitter library](https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
